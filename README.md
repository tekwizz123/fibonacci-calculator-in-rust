# Rust Fibonacci Sequence Calculator
Just a simple little Fibonacci sequence calculator I wrote in Rust, which was part of the challenges proposed in Chapter 3 of The Rust Book. Will take in a number which will then be used as the position in the Fibonacci sequence you would like to retrieve the corresponding number of, and will return this calculated number.

Appologies if any of the code is off, still learning and whilst clippy and rustfmt were pretty helpful at suggesting things and tidying some inefficiencies up (thanks Rust team!), there are almost certainly still be improvements that could be made to this code (such as taking input via the command line for example).
